** Punk Team Update: **

# Punk Team Been Threatened?
Yes The Owner was threatened by ShowerHead The Owner Of Fluxus..???

ShowerHead has every person's ip the people who used his Executor and cracked fluxus keyless
But As I heard that ShowerHead won't release the ip or leak a single

and we might expect a collaboration Punk Team & Fluxus Team

And Punk Team Will Create Their own Executor called Punk Hub I'm sure and yeah stayed tuned everyone
